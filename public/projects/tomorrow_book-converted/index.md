The Tomorrow Book, a school assignment, is one of my early attempts to experiment with text driven design. Within this assignment, I studied various types of content containers in a digital environment and questioned the different reading experiences digital and analogue readers have to offer. As result, the Tomorrow Book was transferred onto a website where it claims that “a new container requires new content”.
This website uses Wikipedia articles in order to generate new reading narratives for books.
