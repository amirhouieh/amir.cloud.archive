2001 a space odyssey is a poster assignment(design by Susana Carvalho) consist of 4 phases/itteration. While the research phase the concepts such as construction and deconstruction and recursive loops came to my focus point. Furthermore I discovered about the technique used by film in order to create a sound in one of the famous senqueces. They used a audio feedback loop where speaker outputs the sound which it creates. Hence this concept lead me a to design a system in which I could create my poster with: a visual feedback loop. 

The setup consist of a typography layer of title of the movie (as the initial material/input) and a tv screen (to output the visuals) and a camera (to catch the visual input).
