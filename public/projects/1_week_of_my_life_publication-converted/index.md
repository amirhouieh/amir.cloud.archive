1 week of my life is a series of artworks about one regular week of my life; one work for one day. This series could be consider as a irrigular data-visualzaition representing the data. The dataset was created by formulating my daily schadule into excel tables â€”categorizing my activities over the time(24hh). In order to make the data more humanized and so more flexible to make narratives, the third parameter was introduced: a parameter which represent my feeling regarding how slow or fast time is passed per activity category. This process results into 5 different datasets (Monday-Friday) which are used as content/input for the artworks. You can see the related projects.

This publication is a generated visual book documenting this series. the book is design and programmed using html, css and javascript in web-browser.
